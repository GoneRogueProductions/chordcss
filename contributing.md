# Contributing to chordCSS
## A few rules...
- Be cordial, everyone is always learning

- No JS it's just to wacko

- Don't be a jerk

- Make an issue if you don't want to code

and make a pull request if you do

- Don't be upset if your pull request isn't merged,
it's not an insult to your skill!

- No vandalism

- Follow the naming conventions I'll explain them later
